title: Database integrations
---

Node.js has a few integrations that support tracking database queries as spans. Starting version `6.4.0`, `@sentry/tracing` will auto-detect supported database drivers or ORMs being used in your project, and automatically enable the relevant integrations with default options - no additional code necessary.

Supported packages and their integration name are, respectively: `pg` (Postgres), `mongodb` (Mongo), `mongoose` (Mongo) and `mysql` (Mysql).

### Disabling automatic instrumentation

To learn how to remove an automatically-enabled integration, please refer to our [integrations](/platforms/node/configuration/integrations/#removing-an-integration) docs.

### Adding integrations manually

If for some reason you need to add a specific database integration manually (for example when using multiple client instances), you can import them from `@sentry/tracing` package, under `Integrations` namespace.

For example, to add MongoDB instrumentation to a custom client:

```javascript
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");
const Tracing = require("@sentry/tracing");
const mongodb = require("mongodb");

const client = new Sentry.NodeClient({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [new Tracing.Integrations.Mongo()],
});
```
