title: Database integrations
---

Node.js has a few integrations that support tracking database queries as Spans. Starting version `6.4.0`, when you are using one of the supported database drivers or ORMs, the integration is installed automatically for you, there is nothing you need to change.

Supported packages and their integration name are respectively: `pg` (Postgres), `mongodb` (Mongo), `mongoose` (Mongo) and `mysql` (Mysql).

### Disabling automatic instrumentation

To remove an integration, please refer to our [integrations](/platforms/node/configuration/integrations/#removing-an-integration) docs.

### Adding integrations manually

If for some reason you need to add a specific database integration manually (for example when using multiple client instances), you can import them from `@sentry/tracing` package, under `Integrations` namespace.

For example, to add MongoDB instrumentation to a custom client:

```javascript
const Sentry = require("@sentry/node");
const Tracing = require("@sentry/tracing");
const mongodb = require("mongodb");

const client = new Sentry.NodeClient({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [new Tracing.Integrations.Mongo()],
});
```
